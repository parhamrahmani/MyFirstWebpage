                                    Many people would disagree with me, but Marriage Story was one of the best pictures that i've seen recently. Great acting by Adam Driver. 
                                    very flexible and interesting plot and some symbolic and artistic scences and shots that emotionaly intrigued me. This Film is not deep nor philosofical ,
                                    but it pictured one of the most common issues in modern society in the best way. It showed the both sides of a seperation and the legal difficulties of it
                                    and how every side/party would lie or change the facts in order to "win" without acknowledging the right thing to do, especially when lawyers are involved.
                                        
                                    Generally this movie is simple but very beautiful and well-made with a very common but important subject. It had some flaws like mediocre acting of the cast in comparison with Johansson and Driver.
                                    But it completely worth watching once or even twice.
