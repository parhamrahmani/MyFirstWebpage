                           My name is Parham and  this is my blog. I like music and i like to write about the albums that i listen to 
                           and share my journey through music. I love movies , so i'm gonna write about them too.
                     </p>

                            One of my favorite movies is "Big Lebowski" and that's why this page is called
                            as Radio Dude. In the contact page you'll have the access to a spotify playlist of songs that i've selected
                            from the albums.
                            This is a blog , so i may write about some other stuff about my life and experiences too , but mostly i'm gonna
                            talk about music and movies.  
                          </p>
